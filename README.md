# Traditional-Computers-VS-Blockchains

- Gauging the state of the blockchain ecosystem by comparing it to the evolution of the modern computer.

Don’t you wish interacting with a blockchain was similar to interacting with your computer?
You boot up the interface, browse your favorite dapp in a clean and simple UI with awareness but not worrying too much about your safety and security, where things work quickly, services are interconnected and compatible and you sometimes wonder how people lived in this world without

I’ve stopped viewing blockchains as distributed ledgers as though that is their most important aspect, we expect them to utilize these ledgers as a complete computer and to be able to facilitate similar functionality.

In this piece I will argue that a blockchain is indeed a computer, made up of very similar parts that function similarly, only that as it is dispersed across millions of computers, that it has a very limited option to delete any information that’s stored on it, that it operates instead of across an electronic circuit, through a the vast, large and slow internet network, but that nevertheless, it should and we’d all want it to try to imitate the performance and structure of our ordinary home computer and that that isn’t actually too much to ask for.

Why me
I've been developing an idea that can help us better understand where blockchain is or should be headed that can be very helpful to many that interact with these systems, including but not limited to developers, users, entrepreneurs, and investors.
That's not a statement that I make lightly.
I've spent the first part of my career designing and building custom computer systems and though I’m fairly young still, I’ve had my chance to tinker with Pentium 80186 computers, I’ve heard my first rock song on a cassette player and I dreaded someone picking up the phone while I was trying to download my first files.

Early computers
Very early computers were usually dedicated machines that were built to assist people with just a few tasks.
Some were only typing machines, some might have come with a printer, there were those that were designed to store records and used mechanical displays to present that data, while other machines were built to help calculate the trajectories of spaceships and assisted us in putting some of the earliest objects into orbit around our earth.
As we know today, the advancement in hardware can be forecast with algorithms such as Moore's law or by observing iterations and generations of technologies. 

There’s way too much history to be able to mention each development but if we look at an ordinary current computer, a desktop, laptop or a mobile device and figure out the path that each of the major components these computers are made of took until it arrived 

As I'd like to introduce this concept, I must grossly over simplify the timeline* and aspects of the modern computers development.

We’re still trying to piece the parts together but let’s say that:

Hard drive speed = the speed at which you write and read to the blockchain
Hard drive capacity = the cost of storage
CPU (Processor) = the speed of processing transactions
GPU (Graphics) = the speed and quality at which the user interface loads information
RAM = a quickly available reduced version of mission critical blockchain data (Doesn’t exist yet)
Keyboard/mouse/touchscreen = the programs that are used to interface with the blockchain
Network communication = blockchain interoperability 
USB = an interface to connect external modules that can interact with the blockchain (IOT devices for example, includes memory cards.
Operating system = would we in the future be able to install our own VM’s onto a Distributed 

Are people that expect the blockchain to be able to facilitate a video game, really that crazy? :)
In any case, we’d like to see more responsive blockchains that have more friendly UI’s.
For the first time in mainstream computing, we expect it to be built with safety and security as a first criteria.


As a matter of fact, blockchains today compared to computers
