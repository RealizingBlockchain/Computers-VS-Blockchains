# The-Blockchain-Computer

The goal of this piece is to create a simple and standard way for anyone disscussing blockchain technologies, to easily interact about them, no matter if they are new to the technology, actively developing it, regulating it or conducting business with it. 

By showing how abstracted blockchains are deeply comparable to the already familiar personal computers, we are able to use familiar language to disscuss the function and properties of any given blockchain system as well as create extensive comparisons between them which can aid in investment and business decisions, removing much of the confusiuon and creating a common language between blockchain developers and the rest of the industry.

Viewing blockchains as computers enables us to easily distinguish the componenets of these complex systems and decide which are required in each disscussion. For example, it is often the case that someone, new to blockchains, asks what a blockchain is used for and instead of being told for instance, 'for decentralized transaction processing', they are told about blocks, teid by encryption, that depend on a decentralized system of nodes to process transactions through a complex mechanism that is used for reaching consensus in the system. Who hasen't been there? quite overwhelming and therefore many people don't understand what a blockchain is supposed to even do, to process pre-programmed transactions. If they were to ask why we couldn't do the same with a single computer, that would be the chance to explain the benefits of a distriobuted and decentralized computer system, their consensus and incentive mechanisms, and all of these amazing things that sit at the heart of these technologies.

Usually however, to avoid misleading people, it's preferable to explain second, the performance limitations that are diffcult to overcome due to these system's distributed nature.

That's where the blockchain computer comes into the picture and the best example is no other than the The Blockchain Computer that runs the Bitcoin application.

Did you know that Bitcoin is not a blockcahin? Bitcoin is the first application to run on the first fully autonomous, decentralized Blockchain computer system (blockchain technology was invented much earlier).

The Blockchain Computer that hosts the Bitcoin currency application:
Performance
Access
Transparency

Ok, Bitcoin is a decentralized system with many nodes that perform a veriaty of operations

The architecture of distributed computing systems, especially decentralized blockchains, is extremely complex. However, while distrbution provides properties such as, redundancy, scalability, security, performance and other advantages, distributed systems by definition are a single computing system. 

IBM definition is as follows: "A distributed computer system consists of multiple software components that are on multiple computers, but run as a single system."

If you think of

A comparison the state of the blockchain ecosystem by comparing blockchains to the evolution of the modern computers.

Don’t you wish interacting with a blockchain as easy as interacting with your computer?
You boot up the interface, browse your favorite dapp in a clean and simple UI, aware but not worried (too much I hope) about your safety and security, where things work quickly, services are interconnected and compatible and you sometimes wonder how people lived in this world without the blockchain.

I've been developing an idea that can help us better understand where blockchain is or should be headed that can be very helpful to many that interact with these systems, including but not limited to developers, users, entrepreneurs, and investors.
That's not a statement that I make lightly.

In the thought process of this idea, I've stopped viewing blockchains as mostly decentralized consensus ledgers, although that is their most important function, we seem to expect them to utilize these ledgers as a complete computer and to be able to facilitate similar functionality rather than remain as ledgers only.

For this reason I'd like to compare the ledger itself to the hard drive of a computer (with the caveat of having an extremely limited delete function).

In this piece I will argue that a blockchain is indeed a computer, made up of very similar parts that function similarly although constructed across many computers, through a the vast, large and slow internet network. Nevertheless, it should and we’d all want it to try to imitate the performance and structure of our ordinary home computer and that that isn’t actually too much to ask for!

I've spent the first part of my career designing, building and deploying custom computer systems and though I’m fairly young, I’ve had my chance to tinker early on with Pentium 80186 computers, I’ve heard my first rock song on a cassette player and I dreaded someone picking up the phone while I was trying to download my first files.

Very early computers were usually dedicated machines that were built to assist people with just a few tasks.
Some were only typing machines, some might have come with a specialized printer, others were designed to store records using mechanical displays to present their data, while other machines were built to help calculate the trajectories of spaceships and assisted us in putting some of the earliest objects into orbit around our earth.
Today we know that the advancement in hardware can be forecast with algorithms such as Moore's law or by observing iterations and generations of technologies (Typing machines, PC's, mobile devices).

Of course, as much as I'd like to, there’s way too much history to get into much depth about each development so instead I'd like to look at an ordinary current computer, a desktop, laptop or a mobile device and figure out the path that each of the major components these computers are made of took until it arrived to it's current state, while at the same time thinking what different aspects of the blockchain need to advance and in what way.

While introducing this concept, I will have to grossly over simplify the many aspects of the development of modern computers.

We’re still trying to piece the parts together but let’s say for now that:

Hard drive speed = the speed at which you write and read to the blockchains permanent storage

Hard drive capacity = the cost of storage

CPU (Processor) = the speed of processing transactions

GPU (Graphics) = the speed and quality at which the user interface loads information

RAM = a quickly available reduced version of mission critical blockchain data (Doesn’t exist yet)

Keyboard/mouse/touchscreen = the programs that are used to interface with the blockchain

Network communication = blockchain interoperability

USB = an interface to connect external modules that can interact with the blockchain (IOT devices for example, includes memory cards.

Operating system = would we in the future be able to install our own VM’s onto a Distributed

Interrupt Descriptor Table = mem-pool

Bios - underlaying communication stack (geth)


Of course, we aren’t trying to run a video game off a blockchain but many blockchain projects would like a video game to be able to interact at real time to save game scores immutably and to load those scores and achievements directly in real time into the flow of the game.

In any case, we’d like to see more responsive blockchains that have more user (and developer) friendly UI’s.

There are also many differences of course, for instance, for the first time in mainstream computing, we expect our systems to be built with safety and security in mind even at the price of progress.
